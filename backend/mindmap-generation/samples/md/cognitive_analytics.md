## Let’s Look at Analytics Models Again


###### What does the AI model think?

## Cognitive Analytics

#### ▪Cognition is the mental action or process of acquiring
 knowledge by understanding true thought, experience and the senses.

 ▪Cognitive processes use existing knowledge and
 generate new knowledge.

 ▪The Purpose of cognitive computing is to perform tasks
 that only humans used to be able to do.

 ▪It augments human capabilities (As opposed to AI which
 just automates)


-----

## Cognitive Analytics

##### ▪Cognitive analytics reveals certain patterns and connections that
 simple analytics cannot.



##### ▪Cognitive computing allows a wide variety of problems previously
 incapable of being solved by fixed program instructions to be calculable and estimable.

 ▪Cognitive analytics can be thought of as analytics with human-like
 intelligence applied to certain tasks, and brings together a number of intelligent technologies, including:

###### – Semantics – Artificial intelligence algorithms – Deep learning – Machine learning.

##### ▪This allows a cognitive application to improve over time.

## Cognitive Analytics

#### ▪It uses several visual perceptions, speech recognition,
 decision-making and NLP (Natural Language Processing) concepts to make sense of previously untapped data from rich sources such as conversational logs, feedback, reviews, social media and so on.

 ▪Applying such techniques, a cognitive application can get
 smarter and more effective over time by (self) learning from its interactions with data and with humans.

 ▪Inferences are not structured queries based on a rules
 database, rather could be unstructured hypotheses gathered from several data sources and expressed with varying degrees of confidence level.

## Cognitive Analytics



##### ▪Cognitive Analytics is intelligent technology that covers
 multiple analytical techniques to analyze large data sets and give structure to the unstructured data.

 ▪Cognitive analytics system searches through the data that
 exists in its knowledge base to find solutions that make sense for the questions posed.

 ▪A cognitive system can create competitive advantage to
 business, providing real-time answers with the ability to:

###### – Search through massive amounts of information

 – Making sense of context and meaning of a sentence

 – Computing the most likely answer.

 – Recognizing certain objects in an image given large amounts of
 information.

## Cognitive Analytics

#### ▪An organization might use cognitive analytics to
 monitor their customer behavior patterns and
 emerging trends. This way the organization can
 predict future outcomes and plan their objectives accordingly to improve their performance.

 ▪Some sections of cognitive analytics also fall under
 predictive analytics, where data in business
 intelligence is used to make predictions.

## How Does Cognitive Computing Work?

### ▪ Adaptive:

###### – Flexible systems which learn as information changes in tandem with
 the evolution of goals and requirements.

 – Cognitive applications must be adaptive in nature.

 – Capable of integrating latest or frequently changing data feeds like
 real-time, or near real-time, to master ambiguity and unpredictability.

### ▪ Interactive:

###### – The cognitive system must be able to interact easily with users so
 that users can define their needs comfortably.

 – Similarly, it must also interact with other processors, devices, and
 Cloud services..


-----

## How Does Cognitive Computing Work?

### ▪ Iterative:

###### – Iterative process to solve problems which are ambiguous

 – The system should remember previous interactions in a process.

 – It should be able to define the problem by asking questions or finding
 an additional source.

 – For this, ensure that the cognitive system is always provided with
 enough validated quality information and that the data sources it operates are reliable and up to date.

### ▪ Stateful:

###### – The system should return information that is suitable for the specific
 application at that point in time.


-----

## How Does Cognitive Computing Work?

### ▪ Contextual:

###### – Cognitive applications should be able to understand, identify, and
 extract contextual elements such as meaning, syntax, time, location, appropriate domain, process, task and goal.


###### – It must draw on multiple sources of information, including both
 structured and unstructured digital information.

### ▪ Dark Data Compatibility:

###### – Cognitive computing systems should be able to deal with “dark data”
 such as social media postings, EMR notes, fitness device readings, unstructured images, videos and the digital or non-digital documents generated by users in day to day life.
 – Cognitive Computing applications process such multi-structured and
 unstructured dark data along with structured information to pull out non-obvious insights and subject it to analytics.

## Real-Life Applications of Cognitive Analytics

#### ▪The medical industry is now starting to use cognitive
 analytics to match its patients with the best possible treatments.



#### ▪Some examples of cognitive analytics which are in use
 today include Microsoft’s Cortana, Apple’s Siri, and IBM’s Watson.

 ▪Organizations are using cognitive analytics to tap into
 unstructured data sources such as images, emails, text documents, and social posts.



#### ▪Though cognitive analytics is still in its infancy, it may be
 the solution to finding real-time answers for large amounts of diverse data, and bringing a paradigm shift from traditional analytics.
