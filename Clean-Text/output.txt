cognitive analytics
▪️ cognition is the mental action or process of acquiring
knowledge by understanding true thought, experience
and the senses.
▪️ cognitive processes use existing knowledge and
generate new knowledge.
▪️ the purpose of cognitive computing is to perform tasks
that only humans used to be able to do.
▪️ it augments human capabilities (as opposed to ai which
just automates)
cognitive analytics
▪️ cognitive analytics reveals certain patterns and connections that
simple analytics cannot.
▪️ cognitive computing allows a wide variety of problems previously
incapable of being solved by fixed program instructions to be
calculable and estimable.
▪️ cognitive analytics can be thought of as analytics with human-like
intelligence applied to certain tasks, and brings together a number of
intelligent technologies, including:
semantics
artificial intelligence algorithms
deep learning
machine learning.
▪️ this allows a cognitive application to improve over time.

cognitive analytics
▪️ it uses several visual perceptions, speech recognition,
decision-making and nlp (natural language processing)
concepts to make sense of previously untapped data from
rich sources such as conversational logs, feedback, reviews,
social media and so on.
▪️ applying such techniques, a cognitive application can get
smarter and more effective over time by (self) learning
from its interactions with data and with humans.
▪️ inferences are not structured queries based on a rules
database, rather could be unstructured hypotheses
gathered from several data sources and expressed with
varying degrees of confidence level.
cognitive analytics
▪️ cognitive analytics is intelligent
technology that covers
multiple analytical techniques to analyze large data sets
and give structure to the unstructured data.
▪️ cognitive analytics system searches through the data that
exists in its knowledge base to find solutions that make
sense for the questions posed.
▪️ a cognitive system can create competitive advantage to
business, providing real-time answers with the ability to:
search through massive amounts of information
making sense of context and meaning of a sentence
computing the most likely answer.
recognizing certain objects in an image given large amounts of
information.
cognitive analytics
▪️ an organization might use cognitive analytics to
monitor
their customer behavior patterns and
emerging trends. this way the organization can
predict
future outcomes and plan their objectives
accordingly to improve their performance.
▪️ some sections of cognitive analytics also fall under
business
data
predictive
intelligence is used to make predictions.

how does cognitive computing work?
▪️ adaptive:
flexible systems which learn as information changes in tandem with
the evolution of goals and requirements.
cognitive applications must be adaptive in nature.
capable of integrating latest or frequently changing data feeds like
real-time, or near real-time, to master ambiguity and
unpredictability.
▪️ interactive:
the cognitive system must be able to interact easily with users so
that users can define their needs comfortably.
similarly, it must also interact with other processors, devices, and
cloud services..
how does cognitive computing work?
▪️ iterative:
iterative process to solve problems which are ambiguous
the system should remember previous interactions in a process.
it should be able to define the problem by asking questions or finding
an additional source.
for this, ensure that the cognitive system is always provided with
enough validated quality information and that the data sources it
operates are reliable and up to date.
▪️ stateful:
the system should return information that is suitable for the specific
application at that point in time.
how does cognitive computing work?
▪️ contextual:
cognitive applications should be able to understand, identify, and
extract contextual elements such as meaning, syntax, time, location,
appropriate domain, process, task and goal.
it must draw on multiple sources of information, including both
structured and unstructured digital information.
▪️ dark data compatibility:
cognitive computing systems should be able to deal with "dark data"
such as social media postings, emr notes, fitness device readings,
unstructured images, videos and the digital or non-digital documents
generated by users in day to day life.
cognitive computing applications process such multi-structured and
unstructured dark data along with structured information to pull out
non-obvious insights and subject it to analytics.
real-life applications of cognitive analytics
▪️ the medical industry is now starting to use cognitive
analytics to match its patients with the best possible
treatments.
▪️ some examples of cognitive analytics which are in use
today include microsoft's cortana, apple's siri, and ibm's
watson.
▪️ organizations are using cognitive analytics to tap into
unstructured data sources such as images, emails, text
documents, and social posts.
▪️ though cognitive analytics is still in its infancy, it may be
the solution to finding real-time answers for large
amounts of diverse data, and bringing a paradigm shift
from traditional analytics.
real-life applications of cognitive analytics
cognitive analytics: pros and cons
advantages
▪️ reduction in human
error
▪️ prevention of wrong
decision by machines.
▪️ available 24x7
▪️ helping in repetitive
jobs
▪️ digital assistance
▪️ faster decisions
disadvantages
▪️ security
▪️ change management
▪️ lengthy and costly
development cycles
▪️ making humans lazy
▪️ no emotions
▪️ unemployment
▪️ lacking out of box
